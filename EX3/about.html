    <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
    <p>
      Dr Inge Van Boxelaer witnessed firsthand the challenges her team faced
      when learning to use Medtronic Pumps and the MiniMed 670G system. <strong>Limited
      access to demos and educational resources created difficulties.</strong> The firm
      could only offer in-person training after a purchase decision, which was
      inconvenient and often rescheduled due to the pandemic.

      <strong>This struggle sparked an idea. </strong>If her own team faced these hurdles,
      countless others must be experiencing them too. Inge envisioned a better
      way to educate healthcare providers and patients about this life-changing
      technology. Time and cost-efficiency were paramount.

        <em>The solution? Online courses.</em>
        <p>Inge meticulously researched all available information, personally wore the pumps and sensors, and documented every step of the process through clear and informative videos. The online courses empowered her team with confidence and provided patients with a valuable reference tool.</p>

    <p><strong>Inge's dedication didn't stop there.</strong> After two years of creating courses for various AID systems, <strong>she embarked on a new mission.</strong> Partnering with her team, they completely revamped the courses, structuring them within a multilingual platform. This broadened accessibility, ensuring even more people could benefit from this independent form of diabetes technology education.

        Inge's story is a testament to the transformative power of knowledge and the drive to make a difference. Through her online courses, she empowers healthcare providers and patients around the world to manage diabetes more effectively.</p>
